# ExspPlugin

This is a plugin for [ExSharedPreference](https://github.com/mhmzx/ExSharedPreference) support, if the version of [ExSharedPreference](https://github.com/mhmzx/ExSharedPreference) you are using is not lower than `1.0.0-alpha08`, you need to install this plugin.

**Notice: This plugin provides the same function of adding `getters`/`setters` as `lombok`, so it may cause conflicts with lombok plugins in some cases, and we are trying to avoid these situations.**
